#Quant Algos & OSX 

##QuantConnect & Me

A couple months ago, I participated in a hackathon at Quantopian. I was intrigued by the idea of placing quant algo backtesting in the hands of the masses, but found their python platform overly constrictive. Subsequently, I spent some time trying to take advantage of the open source nature of QuantConnect's Lean Engine to devise a local backtesting environment. Having spent time working with both services, I discovered QuantConnect's Lean Engine is not conducive to the OSX environment, and is therefore just as suppressive as Quantopian for Mac users.

##The Dilemma

Although QuantConnect's [Lean Engine Repo](https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean) claims to offer OSX functionality, this is *barely* true. The documentation for Mac is vague at best, and seems written by someone who doesn't actually own a Mac.

Eventually, I got the Lean project to build in Xamarin Studio using the Mono framework (despite numerous compile warnings), and I got their sample algo to run a backtest in the CLI by navigating to the **Lean/Launcher/bin/Debug** and running `mono ./QuantConnect.Lean.Launcher.exe`. This produced the following results:

It seemed at this point I should be able to backtest any algo locally, but I later learned it's not that simple. The crux of any backtest is historical data, and the Lean repo only includes a week of sample data from 2013. [This thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/lean-engine/W_f9hDNoHIs) indicates there's a way to download your own data from a 3rd party API, but it's a complex solution with lots of dependencies. These hurdles are complicated tenfold if you're working on a Mac.

Since QuantConnect uses a RESTful API, one could theoretically spin their own backtesting environment in the language of their choice. Doing so would be a considerable project, and you'd still be at the mercy of the QuantConnect, as they can view and regulate any API call you make. It wouldn't be as powerful as their browser platform either, because the Lean repo only contains the *engine* that their site runs on, while the platform spins in a ton of features that would be tough to replicate locally.

Contrary to how these services are advertised, I came to realize that a knowledge of coding is secondary to an exhaustive understanding of quantitative analysis (*knowing English doesn't qualify me to write a game-changing biography on Abraham Lincoln; I'd need to study for years to gain any insight that experts don't already know*). Since people spend entire careers coming up with ways to game the stock market, an amateur designing a game-changing algo is as unlikely as winning the lottery, but far less lucrative. QuantConnect would reap most of the profits, kicking a small percentage back to the author.

##The "Solution"

In spite of their open source repo, the only way I could find to reasonably use QuantConnect on a Mac, is to go through the front door: register with them, and run backtests right from their website's [terminal interface](https://www.quantconnect.com/terminal/). This makes QuantConnect essentially no different than Quantopian, except for the added flexibility of being able to write algos in C# or F# in addition to Python. Using their browser terminal is free for backtesting purposes, but they charge a $20 monthly fee to deploy an algorithm live (Quantopian lets you do it for free).

You can use the sample algos provided in the lean repo as a starting point. I've posted a condensed collection of those [here](https://github.com/efournier92/QuantConnect-Algos)

Pasting a sample algo into their platform terminal will output detailed backtest results like this:

##Conclusion

For Mac users, there's not much difference between QuantConnect and Quantopian in terms of user freedom. QuantConnect allows some extra flexibility in which language you use, while Quantopian lets you deploy live algos for free. At the end of the day, these are *companies*, with business models to uphold. Therefore, even QuantConnect, with the illusion of an open-source repo, takes steps to ensure they get the lion's share of profits generated by a winning algo. Whether or not these companies will make enough to stay afloat I can't say, but I'm convinced there's no real money in it for the average person (Mac user or not).
